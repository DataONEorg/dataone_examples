To this end, photosynthesis measurements were made on 6 days in June, July and August of 1987 at three different locations in the northwest quadrant of the FIFE study area.  Leaf photosynthetic rate is measured by enclosing a leaf in a closed, transparent chamber and measuring the decrease in carbon dioxide concentration as a function of time. Light flux density is measured outside of the chamber and must be corrected for the chamber transmittance, which is 0.9.  These data can be fit to various models of leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance by providing the responses to light, temperature leaf water potential, and carbon dioxide under field conditions on intact plants.\",\n",

The objectives of the study were to estimate canopy photosynthetic rates, respiration rates, and bulk stomatal resistance. Photosynthesis was measured by monitoring the net exchange of CO2 from the canopy to the atmosphere while the canopy is enclosed in a Plexiglas chamber equipped with a LI-COR CO2 gas analyzer. The rate of CO2 concentration change over intervals of 10 - 20 seconds is measured. This CO2 concentration rate of change is used along with other factors (e.g., the amount of canopy area enclosed, the volume of the enclosure, and temperature) to estimate the net photosynthesis rate. The stomatal resistance and conductance is calculated from the total leaf resistance (i.e., calculated via the transpiration rate along with the leaf and air temperatures) minus the boundary layer resistance. Stomatal resistance of selected species of the grass used to estimate the total canopy resistance were measured independently using a leaf diffusion porometer.  The results showed that estimated values of net CO2 flux varied between about 0.25 and 1.0 [mg][m^-2][sec^-1] during IFC-2 and IFC-3, and around zero during IFC-4. Resistances ranged from 80 [sec][m^-1] to 300 [sec] [m^-1] during IFC-2 and IFC-3, rising to very high values (greater than 1000 [sec][m^-1]) during IFC-4.\",\n",
