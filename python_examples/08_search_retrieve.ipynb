      "                <description>Study Location Selection: Study locations for the Tasmanian Platypus Survey were selected a) by defining the spatial scale of interest to assess the distribution of the fungal disease 'mucormycosis' and b) by creating a comprehensive database of platypus records in Tasmania to quantify the spatial and temporal distribution and prevalence of platypus mucormycosis across Tasmania (Gust et al 2009). Mucormycosis is caused by the fungus Macur amphibiorum, previously isolated from frogs and toads, however also infects free-living platypus in rivers in Tasmania. The fungus is responsible for the severe ulcerative skin condition in platypus (Munday and Peel 1983, Obendorf et al 1993). The spatial scale of interest for fungal disease assessment has been defined as individual river catchments in Tasmania and King Island in Brass Straight. These river catchments are discrete management and conservation units, and contain a network of interconnecting water bodies, where platypus can potentially interact and breed. Catchment boundaries around Tasmania's 48 planning and management river catchments are defined by Land Information Service Tasmania at the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment. The database of historic platypus mucormycosis records in Tasmania was established using a wide variety of sources, including published scientific literature, museum records and public observations.Catchment disease status classification method: Historically disease affected catchments are identified for trapping surveys.Catchments were classified into four qualitative disease status categories according to available evidence based on desktop assessment of historical data and public sightings. Animal capture: Live trapping surveys are conducted across Tasmania to quantify patterns of natural spatial and seasonal variation in the morphometric and demographic characteristics of platypuses and to determine the spread, prevalence and persistence of the ulcerative fungal disease mucormycosis in Tasmanian platypus.Live trapping surveys are conducted in 18 Tasmanian river catchments and 75 waterways between January 2008 and June 2009. The sampling strategy concentrates effort in nine historically affected catchments, five possibly affected catchments, and four catchments outside the known distribution of mucormycosis, including King Island. Sampling effort within catchments is spread across multiple waterways. King Island in Brass Straight is also surveyed in January 2009 because its small, isolated platypus population may be particularly vulnerable to mucormycosis due to low genetic diversity. Animal processing:To quantify patterns of natural spatial and seasonal variation in the morphometric and demographic characteristics of platypuses and to determine the spread, prevalence and persistence of the ulcerative fungal disease mucormycosis in platypus. Morphometric and demographic patterns in Tasmania platypuses caught during the live trapping survey in 2008-09 are examined to provide a basis for investigating impacts of mucormycosis or other anthropogenic disturbances. Additionally, important spatial scales of natural variability and the magnitude of seasonal variation in platypus body size, condition, health and population structure are identified. Captured animals are processed 30 min of retrieval from nets and released at the capture location immediately after processing. Animal blood parameter analysis: 1. To determine the association between mucormycosis in Tasmanian platypuses and hematologic and biochemical measures, trypanosome infections, altitude and other parameters. 2. To compare hematologic and plasma biochemical measures of free-ranging Tasmanian platypuses in river catchments grouped by their mucormycosis disease status. 3. Establish robust reference intervals for some hematologic and biochemical measures in free-living platypuses. Broad spectrum haematological and parasite load analysis are conducted on blood samples collected during trapping survey across 75 rivers and streams between January 2008 and June 2009. Blood sampling is conducted on 183 individuals (Geraghty et al 2011).</description>\n",
